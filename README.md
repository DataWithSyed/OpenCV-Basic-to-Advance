# Python & OpenCV Tutorial Series

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python scripts and tutorials that cover both fundamental programming concepts and a wide range of computer vision techniques using OpenCV. These materials are perfect for beginners in Python as well as those interested in exploring image processing and computer vision.

## Repository Contents

### Python Basics
This section covers essential Python programming concepts, from basic syntax to more advanced topics. These scripts are designed to help beginners build a strong foundation in Python before moving on to computer vision tasks.

- **Lec 01-13**: Python Basics — Includes operators, variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Lec 14-28**: Advanced Python Concepts — Covers concepts like classes, methods, and functions with default arguments.

### OpenCV & Image Processing
This section introduces OpenCV, a popular library for computer vision tasks. The tutorials range from fundamental operations like reading, writing, and manipulating images to more complex techniques, including image blending, object detection, and edge detection.

- **Image Reading and Writing**:
  - **Lec 03-05**: Reading and writing images in OpenCV, with best practices.
  
- **Basic Image Operations**:
  - **Lec 30-32**: Capturing and saving video frames.
  - **Lec 33-38**: Drawing shapes, handling mouse events, and performing basic arithmetic on images.

- **Thresholding and Contouring**:
  - **Lec 48-49**: Simple and adaptive thresholding techniques.
  - **Lec 63**: Finding and drawing contours on images.
  
- **Color Spaces and Object Detection**:
  - **Lec 30-31**: RGB and grayscale video capture.
  - **Lec 45-47**: Object detection using HSV color space and trackbars for real-time adjustments.

- **Morphological Operations**:
  - **Lec 53-56**: Dilation, erosion, opening, closing, and advanced morphological transformations.

- **Advanced Techniques**:
  - **Lec 60-62**: Image pyramids and blending techniques.
  - **Lec 64**: Basic motion detection and tracking.
  - **Lec 65-66**: Shape and histogram analysis.
  - **Lec 69**: Template matching for object recognition.

### Visualization Tools
The repository also includes tutorials on visualizing data and image processing results using libraries like Matplotlib and Pyplot:
- **Lec 51-52**: Integrating Matplotlib with OpenCV for better image display.
- **Lec 66-68**: Histogram analysis for grayscale and RGB channels, including Pyplot and OpenCV-based methods.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
   - Matplotlib (for data visualization)

2. **Running the Scripts**:
   Each script is standalone and demonstrates specific functionality. Simply clone the repository, navigate to the desired file, and run it to explore Python fundamentals or OpenCV techniques.
